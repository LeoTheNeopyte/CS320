Assigment 1

Part_1:
Only outputs my name

- Simple program similar to hello world

Part_2:
Program ask for name and says hi back.

- the program can only take a sting of characteds

Part_3:
Program outputs the hyperbolic cos of a number.

-Program does not work if user enters a negative integer
- input is in degrees not radiants

Part_4;
Just like part_3, program 4 shows the cosine  of a number but it does it for multiple x and y cordinates

- while compiling the first digit is for the range and the second is for the steps between the range 
EX:   ./a.out 5 15 
will output 
	0.00 15.00 30.00 45.00 60.00
	1.00 0.97  0.87  0.71  0.50
